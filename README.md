# Heart Disease Prediction
A project that predicts whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not.
The project involves training a machine learning model (K Neighbors Classifier) to predict whether someone is suffering from heart disease with 87% accuracy.


# HEART DISEASE PREDICTOR  :chart:	
This project is an individual contribution.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
This project aims to build various Machine & Deep Learning Models that will predict C.L.V by learning from the previous data. Furthermore, choosing the most appropriate model based on its accuracy score.
